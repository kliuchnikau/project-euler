#Before you continue:
If you are working on some problem from projecteuler.com at the moment I encourage you not to read my solutions. This will likely deny you a lot of fun and insights while solving the problem yourself. Otherwise please welcome and share you thoughts about my code / advice on how to improve my Haskell / let me know about interesting algorithms!
